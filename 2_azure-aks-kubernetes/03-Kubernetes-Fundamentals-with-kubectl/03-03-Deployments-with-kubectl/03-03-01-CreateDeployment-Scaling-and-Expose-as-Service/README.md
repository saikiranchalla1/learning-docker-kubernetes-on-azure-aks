# Kubernetes - Deployment

## Step-01: Introduction to Deployments
- What is a Deployment?
- What all we can do using Deployment?
- Create a Deployment
- Scale the Deployment
- Expose the Deployment as a Service

## Step-02: Create Deployment
- Create Deployment to rollout a ReplicaSet
- Verify Deployment, ReplicaSet & Pods
- **Docker Image Location:** https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/stacksimplify/kubenginx
```
# Create Deployment
kubectl create deployment <Deplyment-Name> --image=<Container-Image>
kubectl create deployment my-first-deployment --image=stacksimplify/kubenginx:1.0.0 

# Verify Deployment
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get deploy 

# Describe Deployment
kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>
kubectl describe deployment my-first-deployment

# Verify ReplicaSet
kubectl get rs

# Verify Pod
kubectl get po
```
## Step-03: Scaling a Deployment
- Scale the deployment to increase the number of replicas (pods)
```
# Scale Up the Deployment
kubectl scale --replicas=10 deployment/<Deployment-Name>
kubectl scale --replicas=10 deployment/my-first-deployment 

# Verify Deployment
kubectl get deploy

# Verify ReplicaSet
kubectl get rs

# Verify Pods
kubectl get po

# Scale Down the Deployment
kubectl scale --replicas=2 deployment/my-first-deployment 
kubectl get deploy
```

## Step-04: Expose Deployment as a Service
- Expose **Deployment** with a service (LoadBalancer Service) to access the application externally (from internet)
```
# Expose Deployment as a Service
kubectl expose deployment <Deployment-Name>  --type=LoadBalancer --port=80 --target-port=80 --name=<Service-Name-To-Be-Created>
kubectl expose deployment my-first-deployment --type=LoadBalancer --port=80 --target-port=80 --name=my-first-deployment-service

# Get Service Info
kubectl get svc

```
- **Access the Application using Public IP**
```
http://<External-IP-from-get-service-output>
```
